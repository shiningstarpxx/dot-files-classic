----------------------------------------------------------------------

This set of Document Type Definitions bundles several common HTML DTDs
with a DTD of OpenACS XQL files. The set is intended for use with:

 - OpenACS (http://openacs.org) and 
 - Emacs (http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) 

but can be used by other applications too. 

The only OpenACS specific additions are the included XQL DTD and the
default document types for files starting with the <queryset> or
<master> tags. 

To get the most out of the DTDs when editing OpenACS files also
install the OpenACS Emacs module oacs.el. The latest version of this
module can be downloaded from:

 - http://www.thecodemill.biz/services/oacs

INSTALLATION

 1. Unzip and untar the oacs-dtds.tgz archive.

 2. Move the dtd directory to a permanent location. 

    E.g. /usr/share/emacs/dtd

 3. Let Emacs know where the catalog of DTDs has been installed by
    adding the following line to your .emacs file.

    (add-to-list 'sgml-catalog-files "/usr/share/emacs/dtd/catalog")

 4. Save your .emacs file and restart Emacs.


VERIFICATION

Optionally test the installation of the DTDs and the OpenACS module
oacs.el as follows:

 1. Create a new HTML file called dummy.html.

 2. From the menu select DTD > Insert DTD > HTML 4.01 Transitional.

 3. Type C-c C-e and accept the html tag.

 4. The installation is in working order when dummy.html consists of:

    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/loose.dtd">
    <html>
      <head>
        <title></title>
      </head>
      <body></body>
    </html>
